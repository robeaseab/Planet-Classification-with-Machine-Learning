# Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.  To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this project I:

* [Preprocessed the raw data](#Preprocessing) prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.
* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters. [Tuned the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
* [Compared the models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)
* Evaluated model performance to determine the best model performance.
