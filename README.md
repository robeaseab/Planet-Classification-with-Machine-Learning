Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.  To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this project I:

* Preprocessed the raw data prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.
* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Compared the models and evaluated model performance to determine the best model performance.
